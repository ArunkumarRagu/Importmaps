# Import Maps in Rails - README

## Introduction

Import Maps is a new feature introduced in Rails 7 that allows us to easily import third-party JavaScript libraries into our Rails applications. With Import Maps, we can get rid of traditional tools like Webpack, Node.js, and Yarn, which were previously used for handling JavaScript libraries. Instead, Import Maps offer a simpler and more streamlined approach to managing JavaScript dependencies.

## Benefits of Using Import Maps

- **Simplified Dependency Management:** Import Maps eliminate the need for complex build tools like Webpack and Node.js, making the setup and maintenance of JavaScript libraries easier and more straightforward.

- **Efficient NPM Package Loading:** By leveraging JSPM (JavaScript Package Management), Import Maps enable loading fully optimized NPM packages, enhancing the performance of our Rails applications.

- **Seamless Integration:** Import Maps smoothly integrate with the Rails ecosystem, making it a native and convenient choice for JavaScript module management.

## Getting Started

To start using Import Maps in your Rails application, follow these steps:

1. Add the `importmap-rails` gem to your Rails application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'importmap-rails'
```

2. Run `bundle install` in the terminal to install the new gem.

3. Next, run the following command to generate the Import Map configuration file:

```bash
rails importmap:install
```

This will create the file `config/importmap.rb`, where you can define your JavaScript module mappings.

4. Add the following line in your `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` file to include the JavaScript modules defined in the Import Map:

```erb
<%= javascript_importmap_tags %>
```

## Configuring the Import Map

In the `config/importmap.rb` file, you can define your JavaScript module mappings. For example:

```ruby
# config/importmap.rb
pin "application", preload: true
pin "jquery", to: "https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"
```

The above configuration maps the module name "application" to the local path `/assets/application.js` (for preloading) and the module name "jquery" to the remote URL `"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"`.

## Conclusion

By leveraging Import Maps in Rails 7, you can now easily manage third-party JavaScript libraries without the complexities of Webpack, Node.js, and Yarn. This streamlined approach makes it efficient to include optimized NPM packages and seamlessly integrate JavaScript dependencies into your Rails application.
